- 'i' doesn't become a real number at collapse, it cancels across the braket

- if 'i' remains during expectation value calculation there is an error in computation of expectation value

- Clifford Gates are the x/y/z/hadamard/cnot gates

- How to decompose complex gates into basic gates
    idea: decomposing custom gates back to a base state of 10 can be done using a dependency graph, aka a topological sort
    of the possible states.
- Simple demos between gate relationships
- Intra-relationship between basic gates is of value to display
