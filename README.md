# JQsim is a simple quantum simulator code exploration

It is based on the below article conceptually, but it is implemented using Java instead of Racket and is a more
complex implementation than the article provides for.

## Phase 1:
~~Currently working on initial implementation to ensure flexibility for any practical number of qubits.~~
~~Implementing Clifford gates~~

## Phase 2:
Implementing entanglement functionality via CNOT
***Currently Working***

## Phase 3: 
Implement a circuit builder to queue gates to apply to each qubit
Finish the Qops class to run the work queue and generate the expectation values
