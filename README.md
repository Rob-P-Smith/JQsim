# JQsim is a simple quantum simulator code exploration

It is based on this article but it is implemented using Java instead of Racket

## Phase 1:
~~Currently working on initial implementation to ensure flexibility for any practical number of qubits.~~

## Phase 2:
~~Implementing Clifford gates~~

## Phase 3: 
Implementing entanglement functionality via CNOT
***Currently Working***

## Phase 4: 
Implement a circuit builder to queue gates to apply to each qubit

## Phase 5: 
Finish the Qops class to run the work queue and generate the expectation values
